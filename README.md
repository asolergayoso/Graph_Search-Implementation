# Graph_Search-Implementation
This python script allows the user to traverse a graph from starting point to goal using ten different algorithms.

To run, make sure you include the graph as a .txt file as sys.argv[1].
The proper representation of a graph on a .txt file can be found on graph_reference.txt
